## ⭐️ Introduction

While significant research has focused on developing embodied reasoning capabilities using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) or integrating advanced VLMs into Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for end-to-end robot control, few studies directly address the critical gap between upstream VLM-based reasoning and downstream VLA policy learning. In this work, we take an initial step toward bridging embodied reasoning with VLA policy learning by introducing <b>Vlaser</b> -- a <b>V</b>ision-<b>L</b>anguage-<b>A</b>ction Model with <b>s</b>ynergistic <b>e</b>mbodied <b>r</b>easoning capability, which is a foundational vision-language model designed to integrate high-level reasoning with low-level control for embodied agents. Built upon the high-quality <b>Vlaser-6M</b> dataset, Vlaser achieves state-of-the-art performance across a range of embodied reasoning benchmarks—including spatial reasoning, embodied grounding, embodied QA, and task planning.
Furthermore, we systematically examine how different VLM initializations affect supervised VLA fine-tuning, offering novel insights into mitigating the domain shift between internet-scale pre-training data and embodied-specific policy learning data. Based on these insights, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the WidowX benchmark and competitive performance on the Google Robot benchmark.
